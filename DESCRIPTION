Description: Wraps the Python implementation of the UMAP dimension reductionality algorithm to use in `R`. Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) is a non-linear dimensionality reduction algorithm that is computationally more efficient than t-SNE (McInnes and Healy, 2018) <https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03426>. This package allows the user to run UMAP from R, producing a data frame that can be plotted on a 2-D graph.
